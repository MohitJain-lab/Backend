Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way humans interact with technology. One of the 
most significant advancements in AI is ChatGPT, a language model capable of 
understanding and generating human-like text. 
How ChatGPT Works 
ChatGPT is powered by a deep learning model called a transformer. It is trained on vast 
amounts of text data to generate meaningful responses based on user input. The model can 
be fine-tuned for specific tasks, including answering questions from a set of documents. 
Using PDFs for Question-Answering 
ChatGPT can retrieve information from PDFs by following these steps: 
1. Extract Text – The content of PDFs is processed and converted into searchable text. 
2. Create Embeddings – Each passage from the PDFs is converted into numerical 
vectors for efficient searching. 
3. Similarity Search – When a user asks a question, the system finds the most 
relevant text snippets from the PDFs. 
4. Generate Answer – The extracted text is provided to ChatGPT, which formulates a 
response based on it.
